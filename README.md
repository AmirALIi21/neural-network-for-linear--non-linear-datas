hey there , this code is based on neural network to predict for linear and non-linear datas and it shows the result on a chart . if the dots are colser to the line it means 
the model is working great and if they are far away from it then it means the model is not working properly . 
the code is prety easy to understand and it dose have comment for better understanding , altough i think you might wanna know more about the reshape and the numbers you have to 
use for those sections .
in line
